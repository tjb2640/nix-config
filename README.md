# My NixOS Configuration

![Alt text](nixos_256.png)

This is my personal [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) configuration.
Right now it's pretty basic and I'm still working on it,
but it seems to be coming along at a nice pace.

## TODO list
- Whittle down or add new configuration options
- Shell config for [Winesweeper](https://github.com/tjb2640/winesweeper)
- ??? TBA

## Cool reference

I have been enjoying [this](https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/preface) 
book from https://github.com/ryan4yin and have been recommending it to folks 
looking to learn NixOS. Go check it out and give it a star!
